##Tech Stack

We implement the Smart contracts using Solidity

The Frontend is developed in Javascript using the  Next.js / React Framework

## AI Component & Rationale

We use OpenAIâ€™s CLIP model to use it to score the similarity of the image created by the users against the prompt they are given.

The reason why we use the CLIP AI is that it is a accurate, automatic, and most importantly, reproducible grader of images that all users can trust.


## Blockchain Component & Rationale

The smart contract create a decentralized bidding system where people can bid on specific pixels to color on the canvas. 

We use blockchain to assist the system in verifying the correct users to reward at the end of a game cycle.
